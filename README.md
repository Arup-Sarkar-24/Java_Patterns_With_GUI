# Pattern Game

## Description
Pattern Game is a Java application that allows users to generate various star patterns based on user-defined inputs. It serves as an educational tool for learning programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and GUI development using Java Swing. The application is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced programmers.

## Features
- **Pattern Generation**:
    - Square Pattern
    - Inverted Pyramid Pattern
    - Left Triangle Pattern
    - Right Triangle Pattern
    - Pyramid Pattern
    - Diamond Pattern
    - Hollow Patterns
    - Butterfly Pattern
    - Cross Pattern
- **User Input**: Enter the number of rows and a string to customize the patterns.
- **Dynamic Method Invocation**: The application dynamically retrieves available pattern methods using Java reflection.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built with Java Swing, providing an intuitive experience for selecting patterns and viewing results.

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA or any other Java IDE that supports Java Swing applications
- **Operating System**: Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arup-Sarkar-24/Java_Patterns_With_GUI.git
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   cd pattern_game
3. **Open in IDE**:

**Usage**

   1.Run the Application:Locate the main class (e.g., MainApp.java) and run it.
   
   2.Select a Pattern: Choose a desired pattern from the dropdown menu in the GUI.
   
   3.Input Parameters:
      .Enter the required number of rows (minimum of 3).
      .Input a string that will be used in the pattern generation.
      
   4.Generate Pattern: Click the "Generate Pattern" button to display the result in the output area.
   
   5.Exit the Application: Click the "Exit" button to close the application.
   
**Code Structure**

    MainApp.java: The entry point for the application, responsible for initializing the GUI and handling user input.
    StarPatternPrinter.java: Contains methods for generating different star patterns.
    InputHandler.java: Manages user input and provides validation for the inputs.
