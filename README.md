# Pattern Game

## Description
Pattern Game is a Java application that allows users to generate various star patterns based on user-defined inputs. It serves as an educational tool for learning programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and GUI development using Java Swing. The application is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced programmers.

## Features
- **Pattern Generation**:
    - Square Pattern
    - Inverted Pyramid Pattern
    - Left Triangle Pattern
    - Right Triangle Pattern
    - Pyramid Pattern
    - Diamond Pattern
    - Hollow Patterns
    - Butterfly Pattern
    - Cross Pattern
- **User Input**: Enter the number of rows and a string to customize the patterns.
- **Dynamic Method Invocation**: The application dynamically retrieves available pattern methods using Java reflection.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built with Java Swing, providing an intuitive experience for selecting patterns and viewing results.

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA or any other Java IDE that supports Java Swing applications
- **Operating System**: Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
